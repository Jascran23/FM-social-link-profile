## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts


### What I learned

During this project I reinforced and learned some important concepts.

- I used @media to fix the responsiveness when the phone is in landscape mode, as the background did not cover the entire screen even though it was 100%.
```css
@media screen and (max-height:480px){
    main{
        height: auto;
        padding: 20px;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue developing and achieve bigger projects with more clarity.


### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - For a better understanding of the flex display
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) -  A great resource for finding and implementing web fonts.
